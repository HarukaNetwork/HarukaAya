bans_help: |
  Some people need to be publicly banned; spammers, annoyances, or just trolls.\n
  This module allows you to do that easily, by exposing some common actions, so everyone will see!\n
  Available commands are:
  - /ban: Bans a user in the chat.
  - /banme: Ban yourself.
  - /tban: Temporarily bans a user in the chat, set time using int<d/h/m> (days, hours or minutes)
  - /unban: Unbans a user in the chat.
  - /sban: Silently bans a user in the chat.
  - /mute: Mute a user in the chat.
  - /tmute: Temporarily mute a user in the chat. set time using int<d/h/m> (days, hours or minutes)
  - /unmute: Unmutes a user in the chat.
  - /kick: Kicks a user from the chat.
  - /kickme: Kick yourself.\n
  All commands work via handle or reply, except banme and kickme(which require no arguments).\n
  An example of temporarily muting someone:
  /tmute @username 2h; this mutes a user for 2 hours.
#Blacklist
modname_blacklist: Word Blacklists
blacklist_active_list: Blacklist filters active in {}:\n
blacklist_no_list: There are no blacklist filters in <b>{}</b>!
blacklist_add: Added <code>{}</code> to the blacklist in <b>{}</b>!
blacklist_del: Removed <code>{}</code> from the blacklist in <b>{}</b>!
blacklist_multi_del: Removed <code>{}</code> triggers from the blacklist in <b>{}</b>!
blacklist_err_add_no_args: Tell me what words you would like to {} the blacklist.
blacklist_err_del_no_args: Tell me what words you would like to remove from the blacklist.
blacklist_err_not_trigger: This isn't a blacklisted trigger!
blacklist_err_multidel_no_trigger: None of those triggers existed, so nothing was removed from blacklist.
blacklist_err_multidel_some_no_trigger: Removed <code>{}</code> triggers from the blacklist in <b>{}</b>! {} did not exist, so were not removed.
blacklist_chatsettings_word_count: There are {} blacklisted words.
blacklist_help: |
  You can set blacklist filters to take automatic action on people when they say certain things. This is done using:
  - /addblacklist <blacklist trigger> <blacklist reason>: blacklists the trigger. You can set sentences by putting quotes around the reason.
  - /unblacklist <blacklist trigger>: stop blacklisting a certain blacklist trigger.
  - /rmblacklist <blacklist trigger>: same as /unblacklist
  - /blacklist: list all active blacklist filters\n
  /addblacklist "the admins suck" Respect your admins!
  This would delete any message containing 'the admins suck'.\n
  Pro tip:
  Blacklists allow you to use some modifiers to match "unknown" characters. For example, you can use the ? character to match a single occurence of any non-whitespace character.
  You could also use the * modifier, which matches any number of any character. If you want to blacklist urls, this will allow you to match the full thing. It matches every character except spaces. This is cool if you want to stop, for example, url shorteners.
  For example, the following will ban any bit.ly link:
  /addblacklist "bit.ly/*" We dont like shorteners!
  If you want to only match bit.ly/ links followed by three characters, you could use:
  /addblacklist "bit.ly/???" We dont like shorteners!
  This would match bit.ly/abc, but not bit.ly/abcd.
#Connections

  Sometimes, you just want to add some notes and filters to a group chat, but you don't want everyone to see; This is where connections come in...
  This allows you to connect to a chat's database, and add things to it without the commands appearing in chat! For obvious reasons, you need to be an admin to add things; but any member in the group can view your data.\n
  Actions are available with connected groups:
  ‚Ä¢ View and edit notes
  ‚Ä¢ View and edit filters
  ‚Ä¢ View and edit blacklists
  ‚Ä¢ Promote/demote users
  ‚Ä¢ See adminlist, see invitelink
  ‚Ä¢ Disable/enable commands in chat
  ‚Ä¢ Mute/unmute users in chat
  ‚Ä¢ Restrict/unrestrict users in chat
  ‚Ä¢ More in the future!\n
  - Type /connect or /connection in the group you want to connect to.
  - /connection or /connect <chatid>: Connect to remote chat
  - /disconnect: Disconnect from chat
  - /allowconnect on/yes/off/no: Allow connect users to group\n
  You can retrieve the chat id by using the /id command in your chat. Don't be surprised if the id is negative; all super groups have negative ids.

cust_filters_err_badformat: This filter could not be sent, as it is incorrectly formatted. Ask in @HarukaAyaGroup if you can't figure out why!
cust_filters_chatsettings_stats: There are `{}` custom filters here.
cust_filters_help: |
  Make your chat more lively with filters; The bot will reply to certain words!
  Filters are case insensitive; every time someone says your trigger words, {} will reply something else! can be used to create your own commands, if desired.
  - /filters: list all active filters in this chat.
  *Admin only:*
  - /filter <keyword> <reply message>: Every time someone says "word", the bot will reply with "sentence". For multiple word filters, quote the first word.
  - /stop <filter keyword>: stop that filter.\n
  An example of how to set a filter would be via:
  `/filter hello Hello there! How are you?`
  A multiword filter could be set via:
  `/filter "hello friend" Hello back! Long time no see!`
  If you want to save an image, gif, or sticker, or any other data, do the following:
  `/filter word`, while replying to a sticker or whatever data you'd like. Now, every time someone mentions "word", that sticker will be sent as a reply.
  Now, anyone saying "hello" will be replied to with "Hello there! How are you?".

feds_help: |
  Ah, group management. Everything is fun, until the spammer starts entering your group, and you have to block it. Then you need to start banning more, and more, and it hurts.
  But then you have many groups, and you don't want this spammer to be in one of your groups - how can you deal with it? Do you have to manually block it in all your groups?

  Not anymore! With Federation, you can make a ban in one chat overlap with all other chats.
  You can even designate admin federations, so your trusted admin can ban all the chats you want to protect.

  Still in the experimental stage, creating a Federation can only be done by my maker.

  Command:
  - /newfed <fedname>: create a new Federation with the name given. Users are only allowed to have one Federation. This method can also be used to rename the Federation. (max. 64 characters)
  - /delfed: delete your Federation, and any information related to it. Will not cancel blocked users.
  - /fedinfo <FedID>: information about the specified Federation.
  - /joinfed <FedID>: join the current chat to the Federation. Only chat owners can do this. Every chat can only be in one Federation.
  - /leavefed <FedID>: leave the Federation given. Only chat owners can do this.
  - /fpromote <user>: promote Users to give fed admin. Fed owner only.
  - /fdemote <user>: drops the User from the admin Federation to a normal User. Fed owner only.
  - /fban <user>: ban users from all federations where this chat takes place, and executors have control over.
  - /unfban <user>: cancel User from all federations where this chat takes place, and that the executor has control over.
  - /setfrules: Arrange Federation rules.
  - /frules: See Federation regulations.
  - /chatfed: See the Federation in the current chat.
  - /fedadmins: Show Federation admin.
  - /fbanlist: Displays all users who are victimised by the Federation at this time.
  - /fedchats: Get all the chats that are connected in the Federation.
  - /importfbans: Reply to the Federation backup message file to import the banned list to the Federation now.

  Markdown is a very powerful formatting tool supported by telegram. Haruka Aya has some enhancements, to make sure that \
  saved messages are correctly parsed, and to allow you to create buttons.
  - <code>_italic_</code>: wrapping text with '_' will produce italic text
  - <code>*bold*</code>: wrapping text with '*' will produce bold text
  - <code>`code`</code>: wrapping text with '`' will produce monospaced text, also known as 'code'
  - <code>[sometext](someURL)</code>: this will create a link - the message will just show <code>sometext</code>, \
  and tapping on it will open the page at <code>someURL</code>.
  EG: <code>[test](example.com)</code>
  - <code>[buttontext](buttonurl:someURL)</code>: this is a special enhancement to allow users to have telegram \
  buttons in their markdown. <code>buttontext</code> will be what is displayed on the button, and <code>someurl</code> \
  will be the url which is opened.
  EG: <code>[This is a button](buttonurl:example.com)</code>
  If you want multiple buttons on the same line, use :same, as such:
  <code>[one](buttonurl://example.com)
  [two](buttonurl://google.com:same)</code>
  This will create two buttons on a single line, instead of one button per line.
misc_md_try: Try forwarding the following message to me, and you'll see!

notes_help: |
  Save data for future users with notes!
  Notes are great to save random tidbits of information; a phone number, a nice gif, a funny picture - anything!

  Available commands are:
   - /save <name> <content>: Save content to a note with the name "name". Replying to a message will save that message. Even works on media!
   - /get <name>: Get the note with the name "name".
   - #<name>: same as `/get name`
   - /clear <name>: delete the note called "name"
   - /notes: List all notes in the current chat
   - /saved: same as /notes

  An example of how to save a note would be via:
  /save data This is some data!
  Now, anyone using "/get data", or "#data" will be replied to with "This is some data!".
  If you want to save an image, gif, or sticker, or any other data, do the following:
  /save word while replying to a sticker or whatever data you'd like. Now, the note at "#word" contains a sticker which will be sent as a reply.

  Tip: to retrieve a note without the formatting, use /get <notename> noformat
  This will retrieve the note and send it without formatting it; getting you the raw markdown, allowing you to make easy edits

  Note: Note names are case-insensitive, and they are automatically converted to lowercase before getting saved.

  - /welcomemute <on/off/yes/no>: all users that join, get muted; a button gets added to the welcome message for them to unmute themselves. This proves they aren't a bot!
  - /welcomemutetime <Xw/d/h/m>: if a user hasnt pressed the "unmute" button in the welcome message after a certain this time, they'll get unmuted automatically after this period of time.
  Note: if you don't want a mute time(mute the user until they press the button), use /welcomemutetime 0m.
  - /setmutetext <new text>: Customise the "click here to prove you're human" button obtained from enabling welcomemutes.
  - /resetmutetext: resets the mute button to the default text.

  Read /markdownhelp to learn about formatting your text and mentioning new users when the join!

  Fillings:
  As mentioned, you can use certain tags to fill in your welcome message with user or chat info; there are:
  {first}: The user's first name.
  {last}: The user's last name.
  {fullname}: The user's full name.
  {username}: The user's username; if none is available, mentions the user.
  {mention}: Mentions the user, using their first name.
  {id}: The user's id.
  {chatname}: The chat's name.

  An example of how to use fillings would be to set your welcome, via:
  /setwelcome Hey there {first}! Welcome to {chatname}.

  You can enable/disable welcome messages as such:
  /welcome off

  If you want to save an image, gif, or sticker, or any other data, do the following:
  /setwelcome while replying to a sticker or whatever data you'd like. This data will now be sent to welcome new users.

  Tip: use /welcome noformat to retrieve the unformatted welcome message.
  This will retrieve the welcome message and send it without formatting it; getting you the raw markdown, allowing you to make easy edits.
  This also works with /goodbye.
