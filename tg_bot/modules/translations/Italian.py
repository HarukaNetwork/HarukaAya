Markdown is a very powerful formatting tool supported by telegram. {} has some enhancements, to make sure that \
saved messages are correctly parsed, and to allow you to create buttons.
- <code>_italic_</code>: wrapping text with '_' will produce italic text
- <code>*bold*</code>: wrapping text with '*' will produce bold text
- <code>`code`</code>: wrapping text with '`' will produce monospaced text, also known as 'code'
- <code>[sometext](someURL)</code>: this will create a link - the message will just show <code>sometext</code>, \
and tapping on it will open the page at <code>someURL</code>.
EG: <code>[test](example.com)</code>
- <code>[buttontext](buttonurl:someURL)</code>: this is a special enhancement to allow users to have telegram \
buttons in their markdown. <code>buttontext</code> will be what is displayed on the button, and <code>someurl</code> \
will be the url which is opened.
EG: <code>[This is a button](buttonurl:example.com)</code>
If you want multiple buttons on the same line, use :same, as such:
<code>[one](buttonurl://example.com)
[two](buttonurl://google.com:same)</code>
This will create two buttons on a single line, instead of one button per line.

Top tip:
Blacklists allow you to use some modifiers to match "unknown" characters. For example, you can use the ? character to match a single occurence of an$
You could also use the * modifier, which matches any number of any character. If you want to blacklist urls, this will allow you to match the full t$
For example, the following will ban any bit.ly link:
/addblacklist "bit.ly/*" We dont like shorteners!
If you wanted to only match bit.ly/ links followed by three characters, you could use:
/addblacklist "bit.ly/???" We dont like shorteners!
